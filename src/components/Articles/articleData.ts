    title: 'Elon Musk claims he is heading for victory in Tesla $56bn pay vote',
    summary: 'Chief says resolutions on his remuneration and electric-car maker’s Texas move are passing by ‘wide margins’',
    content: `
        Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk Claims Shareholders to Vote in Favour of $56bn Pay Award

        Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has claimed that shareholders are set to vote in favour of his $56bn pay award 
        and a proposal to reincorporate the electric-car maker in Texas at its annual meeting on Thursday.

        “Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins,” Musk said on the social media platform X late on Wednesday, thanking investors for their support.

        The results cited by Musk in charts are preliminary and the votes could change at the annual meeting. 
        However, formal approval of the two resolutions would rank as a massive win for the mercurial chief executive, 
        who has fought over the largest pay package in US corporate history.

        Tesla’s board has been lobbying investors to ratify again Musk’s $56bn award — made in 2018 but voided by a Delaware judge in January 
        because of concerns over the board’s transparency and independence. The judgment prompted Musk to demand the company change the 
        location of its incorporation from Delaware to Texas.

        If Tesla is successful in winning investors’ backing for his package, which is composed of stock options, 
        Musk’s stake in the company would increase to more than 20 per cent from 13 per cent if they were exercised. 
        Shares in Tesla rose 3.9 per cent on Wednesday ahead of the vote.

        The shareholder vote has been closely followed, with any defeat hurting Musk’s credibility at a time when Tesla 
        is in a brutal price war with Chinese electric vehicle rivals and suffering spiralling costs because of billions 
        of dollars of investment in artificial intelligence and robotics.

        Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has led the campaign to win support for both proposals, comparing her task to climbing Mount Everest. 
        The company has managed to win the backing of Baillie Gifford’s flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, Cathie Wood’s Ark 
        Investment Management and Ron Baron, another big Tesla investor.

        But Musk’s remuneration package has divided investors, with Norway’s $1.7tn oil fund opposing it, citing the size of the award, 
        its structure and how it fails to mitigate “key person risk”. The chief executive of Calpers — the largest US public pension fund 
        and a top-25 shareholder with a $1.67bn stake — has also said it planned to vote against the deal.

        Why the Tesla shareholder vote won’t be the end of Elon Musk’s Delaware fight

        Both ISS and Glass Lewis, the two largest proxy advisers, have also recommended shareholders reject the massive package.

        In the final weeks, Tesla has ratcheted up its campaign with both current and former executives, as well as engineers, expressing their support for Musk on social media. 
        The carmaker has also offered a tour of Tesla’s factory with Musk to encourage its retail investors to vote in favour.

        Tesla has an unusually high proportion of retail investors — who own about 30 per cent of the company — and the high hurdles for success for both votes, 
        in particular the move to Texas, had meant that their backing would be critical.

        On the pay vote, a simple majority must be in favour, excluding those shares owned by Musk and his brother Kimbal. 
        Reincorporation in Texas has a higher bar, requiring a majority of all shares outstanding, meaning those not cast are counted as a “no”.

    title: 'Sri Lanka reaches deal with creditor nations over $5.8bn of debt',
    summary: 'Agreement to restructure borrowings is ‘significant milestone’ towards ending debt crisis, says finance minister',
    content: `
        Sri Lanka has completed a restructuring of $5.8bn of debt owed to a group of creditor nations, marking a significant step in the cash-strapped south Asian nation’s efforts to exit a two-year-old default.
        
        The finalisation of a deal with a committee of official lenders including India, Japan and France in Paris on Wednesday was a “significant milestone” in ending Sri Lanka’s debt crisis, the country’s finance minister Shehan Semasinghe said on Wednesday. The country was also in the process of signing a deal with China’s Export-Import Bank to restructure more than $4bn of debt, he added.
        
        Sri Lanka has been struggling to overhaul its debts owed to both public and private sector creditors since a sharp economic downturn and currency shortages pushed it to default in 2022. President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government is also racing to restructure a further $13bn of external debt owed to bondholders, as he tries to guide the country out of an acute economic crisis ahead of elections later in the year.
        
        The country has been an important but volatile test case of how China will co-operate with other lenders to resolve defaults after its Belt and Road Initiative lending surge over the past decade made it the largest creditor to developing economies.
        
        Early debt relief negotiations were beset by delays as Beijing eschewed the standard international framework for dealing with debt crises, and insisted on differing treatment for debts owed to a range of Chinese banks.
        
        Sri Lanka also needs to finalise a separate deal with China Development Bank, which is classed as a commercial creditor that is owed about $2.1bn.
        
        Details of the deal announced on Wednesday have not been disclosed. Full terms of the relief from China — which was not part of that deal — or other official creditors are yet to be disclosed.
        
        “The Export-Import Bank of China was the first to tentatively agree with Sri Lanka on debt treatment [in early 2023], which has been crucial for Sri Lanka to advance fiscal reform and win further support from international creditors,” China’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday.
        
        Earlier this month, the IMF’s executive board called for the “comparable, transparent and timely completion” of talks with private creditors as it authorised the latest $336mn tranche of Sri Lanka’s bailout.
        
        In return for accepting losses of roughly one-third, Sri Lanka’s international bondholders have proposed turning their debt into so-called “macro-linked” bonds, which would offer larger payouts if Sri Lanka’s economy outperforms IMF targets. A first round of talks ended in recent weeks with differences over how to define the GDP trigger for these bonds. Sri Lanka is due to resume the talks soon.

    title: 'Russia begins trial of Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges',
    summary: 'Secret proceedings begin against Wall Street Journal reporter as US continues to press Moscow for his release',
    content: `
    Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has appeared in a Russian court to stand trial in a secret proceeding on charges of espionage amid US efforts to secure his release in a prisoner exchange.

    Video footage published by state media showed Gershkovich standing in a glass cage at a district court in Ekaterinburg, a city in Russia’s defence-industrial heartland in the Ural Mountains, ahead of the hearing on Wednesday.

    Gershkovich faces a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison if he is found guilty of espionage.

    Officials have not provided any evidence of Gershkovich’s alleged guilt, despite the Kremlin’s claim to have caught him “red-handed,” or given any information on the scope and duration of his trial.

    US officials are negotiating with Russia for a potential prisoner swap involving Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, a US marine veteran jailed for 16 years on similar charges in 2020, in exchange for Russians held in the west.

    The US embassy in Moscow on Wednesday said Gershkovich “has done nothing wrong and never should have been arrested. His case is not about evidence, procedural norms or the rule of law. It is about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political objectives.

    “Russia should stop using individuals like Evan Gershkovich or Paul Whelan as bargaining chips. They should both be released immediately.”

    Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has said the Kremlin is open to an exchange involving Gershkovich through a “quiet, calm professional approach and dialogue between the secret services”.

    Prosecutors claimed Gershkovich was in Ekaterinburg on an assignment for the CIA to obtain “secret information” about production and repair efforts at Uralvagonzavod, a large tank factory, when he was arrested in March 2023.

    The WSJ vehemently denies the charges against Gershkovich, while the US has declared that he has been wrongfully detained.

    Emma Tucker, the WSJ’s editor in chief, said the proceedings would “not be a trial as we understand it, with a presumption of innocence and a search for the truth”, in a letter to readers published on Wednesday.

    “We already know the conclusion,” she added. “This bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man who would then face up to 20 years in prison for simply doing his job.”

    Gershkovich is one of several journalists arrested in Russia after Putin promptly banned all dissent following his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

    They include Alsu Kurmasheva, a US-Russian dual national journalist at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty who was arrested while visiting family last year. She faces up to 10 years in prison on charges of not registering as a “foreign agent” and “disseminating false information” about Russia’s armed forces, which she denies.

    Gershkovich’s probable conviction is likely to be a prelude to a potential prisoner swap that could involve other US citizens jailed in Russia.

    The US has previously swapped high-profile Russian prisoners for Americans in Russian custody, including arms dealer Viktor Bout who was traded for US basketball star Brittney Griner following her sentencing on drug charges in 2022.

    Putin strongly hinted in February that he was demanding in exchange the release of Vadim Krasikov, a hitman sentenced to life in prison in Germany in 2021.

    Efforts to swap Krasikov for Gershkovich, Whelan and jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, however, collapsed when the dissident died in a remote Arctic penal colony months later.

    Navalny’s supporters have accused Putin of murdering him to scupper the deal. Putin said in March he had agreed to an informal proposal to release Navalny on the condition that he never returned to Russia but denied any involvement in his “tragic” death.

    People briefed on the talks say the Russian president is fixated on releasing Krasikov, who murdered a former Chechen militant in broad daylight in a Berlin park in 2019.

    Russia has jailed several more Americans in recent months, including Gordon Black, a US soldier who was arrested on theft charges while visiting his girlfriend in the eastern city of Vladivostok in May and sentenced to nearly four years in prison last week.

    Ksenia Khavana, a US-Russian dual national, went on trial last week in Ekaterinburg on treason charges for sending a pro-Ukrainian group $51.80 on the first day of Moscow’s invasion. Judge Andrei Mineyev, who is also overseeing Gershkovich’s case, ordered proceedings to be held in secret in that trial too.

    title: 'Ex-Fujitsu engineer tells Post Office inquiry that Horizon system was ‘robust’',
    summary: 'Gareth Jenkins admits there were ‘discrete bugs’ that could lead to accounting problems but they were ‘well controlled’',
    content: `  
  A former Fujitsu engineer has insisted the IT system at the centre of the Post Office scandal was robust, despite the High Court finding it was responsible for wrongful prosecutions.
  
  Gareth Jenkins told a public inquiry on Tuesday that while he accepted there were “discrete bugs” in the Horizon system — developed by Fujitsu — that could result in account discrepancies, they were well controlled and managed.
  
  “They could cause discrepancies in branch accounts but not at the sort of levels that have been talked about,” he said. “In general the systems, I believe, were operating as they should.”
  
  The High Court ruled in a landmark case in 2019 that several “bugs, errors and defects” had meant there was a “material risk” that Horizon was to blame for account shortfalls at the centre of Post Office prosecutions.
  
  More than 900 sub-postmasters were convicted in cases involving faulty data from Horizon following its introduction in 1999. More than 100 convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal before legislation was passed this year to exonerate most victims en masse.
  
  In the 2019 High Court ruling, Mr Justice Fraser wrote that legacy Horizon — a system rolled out to branches from 1999 until 2010 — was not “remotely robust”.
  
  Jenkins said the system was not infallible, but there were “mechanisms in place” to monitor bugs and errors in the system. “There were some discrete bugs that caused some problems to the accounts,” he said.
  
  “They were very discrete and I believe they were well controlled and managed at the time,” he added, though he later conceded that he may have been “wrongly confident” that this was the case.
  
  Jenkins joined Fujitsu in 1973 when it was International Computers. He retired in 2015 but was retained on an ad hoc basis by the IT company as a consultant until August 2022.

	He was deployed by the state-owned Post Office as a witness in the prosecution of Seema Misra, a sub-postmaster who was sentenced in 2010 to 15 months in prison for theft while eight weeks pregnant. Misra’s conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2021.

  Barrister Simon Clarke in 2013 told the Post Office that Jenkins had failed to disclose information in Misra’s case in “plain breach of his duty as an expert witness”.

  Clarke advised that Jenkins should not be used to provide evidence in any “current or future prosecution”.

  Jenkins wrote in his witness statement to the inquiry that he was not aware of Clarke’s guidance. “This advice was highly critical of me and has had far-reaching consequences,” he said.

  Jenkins told the inquiry that the Post Office’s lawyers had attempted to “put words in my mouth” and said he was aware officials had rephrased his evidence to be more unequivocal about the robustness of Horizon.

  He added lawyers did not properly brief him that he was an “expert witness” in the Misra trial — a role that required him to set out any adverse findings — instead he presented a narrow set of evidence. “No one told me I needed to do more than that,” he said.

  The former Fujitsu engineer also assisted the Post Office in the 2019 High Court case.

  The Metropolitan Police has interviewed Jenkins under caution in relation to allegations of perjury and perverting the course of justice following evidence he provided as a witness in Post Office prosecutions. Jenkins has not been arrested or charged with any offence.

    title: 'French far-right leader Jordan Bardella vows ‘cultural battle’ and demands EU rebate',
    summary: 'Party chief ‘convinced’ Rassemblement National will secure an outright parliamentary majority in snap elections',
    content: `
  Jordan Bardella, the far-right candidate to be France’s prime minister, has pledged to fight a “cultural battle” against Islamism and secure an EU budget rebate even as he promised “a lot of pragmatism” on the economy if his party wins snap elections.
  
  The 28-year-old chief of the Rassemblement National party said in a Financial Times interview that he was confident of winning an outright majority in legislative elections, which would force President Emmanuel Macron into a “cohabitation”, or power-sharing government, with a potentially antagonistic counterpart.
  
  “I think the French are ready for change,” said Bardella, adding that the country wanted to “break with seven years of Macronism which has been brutal in its method of governing”. He also committed to using the political “weight” of his election victory to cut France’s contributions to the EU budget by €2bn. “I want to get a rebate,” he declared.
  
  Led by standard-bearer Marine Le Pen, the RN and their rightwing allies lead in polls with a 36 per cent vote share ahead of the two-round election on June 30 and July 7, according to Ifop. The leftwing alliance Nouveau Front Populaire is on 28.5 per cent, and Macron’s Ensemble group is on 21 per cent.
  
  Pollsters say it is too early to make accurate seat predictions for the 577-member National Assembly. A hung parliament is the most likely scenario, but some polls indicate the RN is close to an outright majority of 289 MPs.
  
  The party is reaping a decade-long effort by Marine Le Pen to “detoxify” the movement founded in the 1970s by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who was convicted of hate speech for calling Nazi gas chambers “a detail of history”.
  
  Bardella, who is Le Pen’s most trusted lieutenant, argues the RN is “ready to govern”. He has been scaling back the party’s big-spending economic programme in a bid to reassure jittery markets and corporate bosses.

	Bardella said he was committed to providing military support for Ukraine, as long as it did not lead to escalation with Russia. The RN previously had strong pro-Russia sympathies but has publicly supported Kyiv following Moscow’s full-scale invasion. It continues to oppose Ukraine joining the EU and Nato, and abstained in a vote on France’s security pact with Ukraine last year.

  “My position changed. It will not change again,” Bardella said. However, he would not be drawn on the level of aid he would be willing to provide Ukraine next year; France’s bilateral security pact calls for €3bn in military support this year.

  But the RN has maintained its tough approach to immigration. Bardella said the RN aimed in the coming years to overhaul the French constitution via a referendum to establish a “national preference” for citizens over foreigners for social housing and other welfare benefits. 

  He intends to pass a law this summer to end birthright citizenship for people born in France to foreign parents, a practice that has existed since 1515 and now requires those with foreign-born parents to officially request citizenship at age 18.

  He argued France’s approach to birthright citizenship “no longer made sense” given how global conflicts, climate change and demography would lead to “massive arrivals” of immigrants. “I intend to take back control of immigration in our country,” he said.

  Experts say ending birthright citizenship may not pass constitutional review and would plunge many French families into administrative limbo.

  The RN intends to move ahead with a proposed law that states as its aim “to combat Islamist ideologies”. It includes measures to make it easier to close mosques and deport imams deemed to be radicalised, and a ban on clothing that “constitute in themselves an unequivocal and ostentatious affirmation” of Islamist ideology. 

  Bardella said this would include various types of veils and the so-called burkini, or head-to-toe swimwear. “The veil is not desirable in French society,” he said. “The battle is in part legislative, but is also a cultural battle that needs to be pursued.” 

  Some of the RN’s economic proposals remain unfunded and scant on detail, such as cutting income tax for those under 30 to combat brain drain and the repeal “in principle” of Macron’s retirement age increase from 62 to 64. Bardella wants to undertake an audit of public finances before deciding spending priorities in the autumn. 

  But he said his first move if the RN takes power would be to boost working-class people’s purchasing power by cutting value added tax on energy and petrol, which he says would cost €12bn a year. Funding is to come from taxing windfall profits of energy companies, closing tax loopholes on maritime shipping companies, and cutting France’s annual contribution to the EU budget by €2bn, he said.

  Analysts have questioned the feasibility of the revenue-raising moves.

  The far-right programme could contravene EU rules on several fronts, including lowering VAT, withdrawing from the EU’s electricity market, and giving preferential treatment to French companies in public procurement.

  Nevertheless, Bardella said: “I do not intend to go to war with Brussels.”

  “I just want France to defend its interests . . . For more than a decade, France has renounced doing so on the European scene,” he said. Asked if he would act unilaterally, he said he would negotiate with the European Commission on the budget and other issues, using his electoral mandate as leverage.
  
  “I think economic policy consists of a handful of core convictions and a lot of pragmatism to ensure trust and stability for the business community,” he said. 

	EU officials see such a wholesale negotiation of France’s EU payments as unfeasible given the common budget is decided unanimously by the EU’s 27 member states every seven years, with the next round due in 2027.

  In a shift from what some RN MPs said earlier, Bardella stopped short of committing to bring France’s deficit back to 3 per cent of GDP by 2027, which is the level set out by EU rules. 

  “It remains an objective,” he said. “It’s obvious that the room to manoeuvre on the budget will be limited, which will require me to prioritise.”

	France overshot its deficit target this year to finish at 5.5 per cent of GDP, denting Macron’s economic record that was once seen as a strength.

  French voters have yet to decide if they want to give Bardella a mandate to carry out such policies. Although he has said he will only accept being prime minister if the RN has an outright majority, Bardella says he is now “convinced” that he will have one. 

  In France, the president chairs meetings of the cabinet of ministers, an arrangement that risks being conflictual. Asked what he would tell Macron in the very first session, Bardella paused and said: “Things are going to change now.”

    title: 'UBS shakes up wealth business to align more closely with investment bank',
    summary: 'Move builds on long-term strategy by Switzerland’s biggest lender to sell more banking services to ultra-rich clients',
    content: `
  UBS has shaken up its wealth management business in preparation for the division’s new co-heads, Iqbal Khan and Rob Karofsky, taking charge next week.
  
  The reorganisation, announced to staff on Thursday morning, is designed to make its dominant wealth management business closer aligned to its investment bank and asset management unit.
  
  It builds on a long-term strategy by Switzerland’s biggest bank of trying to sell more banking services to its ultra-rich clients, while converting investment banking customers into wealth management account holders.
  
  “Our most important priority will remain unchanged: delivering exceptional outcomes for clients every day,” said Khan and Karofsky in a staff memo, seen by the Financial Times.
  
  Last month, UBS announced that Khan — who previously ran the bank’s wealth management business by himself — would share the responsibility with Karofsky, who previously ran the group’s investment bank.
  
  Khan was also made head of Asia-Pacific, while Karofsky was put in charge of the Americas.
  
  The reshuffle was seen as UBS preparing two of its most likely successors to chief executive Sergio Ermotti.
  
  Under the changes announced on Thursday, which people briefed on the plans said Khan and Karofsky had been working on since the start of the year, former Credit Suisse executive Yves-Alain Sommerhalder was given oversight of various business lines that bring the wealth management business closer to other parts of the bank.
  
  From next week, Sommerhalder will head a new division called GWM Solutions, which will oversee units focused on investment management, markets, lending, ultra-rich clients and alternative investments.
  
  In a sign of the growing importance of the Asian market for UBS, the bank said Patrick Grob, who would lead the new alternative investments division within GWM Solutions, would relocate to the region and from September be president of the Asia-Pacific business.
  
  UBS also said its Latin American business, which was bolstered by teams joining from Credit Suisse, would be split out from its Americas division and continue to be led by Marcello Chilov.
  
  Meanwhile, Jason Chandler will switch from being head of GWM Americas to chair, with Michael Camacho brought in from JPMorgan to be head of GWM US.`,

    title: 'German AI defence start-up Helsing poised to triple valuation to $4.5bn',
    summary: 'Silicon Valley investors Accel and Lightspeed part of latest fundraising round talks that would raise almost $500mn',
    content: `
European defence technology start-up Helsing is in talks to raise almost $500mn from Silicon Valley investors including Accel and Lightspeed Venture Partners at a valuation of $4.5bn, tripling its price tag in less than a year, as global conflicts stoke a wave of private investment in military suppliers.

Accel and Lightspeed will be new investors in Helsing, said people familiar with the discussions, and are likely to be joined in the round by General Catalyst, an existing backer.

The deal would make Munich-based Helsing one of Europe’s most valuable artificial intelligence start-ups, in a strong signal of traditional venture capital investors’ growing appetite for defence tech companies. Accel, an early backer of Facebook and Spotify, has not previously invested in a defence tech company.

Helsing and Lightspeed declined to comment. Accel and General Catalyst did not immediately return requests for comment.

Founded in 2021, Helsing specialises in AI-based software for defence. It uses AI to process vast amounts of data generated by sensors and weapons systems to offer real-time battlefield intelligence and help militaries in their decision-making. The company’s software is also being used to develop AI capabilities for drones in Ukraine.

Helsing’s last round, announced in September, raised €209mn at a valuation of about €1.5bn, including the new funds raised. The new round under discussion would value the company at $5bn, which would include the new capital, people familiar with the talks said.

That price tag puts Helsing in the ranks of Europe’s most highly valued private tech companies alongside Paris-based Mistral, an AI start-up that raised €600mn at a valuation of almost €6bn earlier this month.

Venture investors had long been wary of investing in defence tech companies but that is changing rapidly in the US and Europe, as tensions between the US and China and Russia’s war in Ukraine have galvanised an increase in defence spending by nation states.

This year, Nato began investing its new €1bn “innovation fund” in European tech companies. Andrea Traversone, the fund’s managing partner, told the Financial Times earlier this month that Europe was “catching up very fast” to US investment in defence and dual-use technologies.

The war in Ukraine has underlined how modern warfare is shifting from the use of traditional hardware such as tanks, guns and munitions to more software-defined technologies to enable troops to outsmart the enemy.

Helsing has signed partnership deals with some of Europe’s established defence contractors, including Germany’s Rheinmetall and Sweden’s Saab, to integrate AI into existing platforms such as fighter jets. The start-up is also working with Airbus on AI technologies that will be used in manned and unmanned systems.

The company has received financing from Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek’s investment company, Prima Materia, which backed Helsing in 2021 with €100mn at a valuation of just over €400mn.

Helsing is seen by some as Europe’s answer to Anduril, the California-based defence tech start-up, which is set to close a $1.5bn fundraising round next month. Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Virginia-based Sands Capital will co-lead that investment, valuing the seven-year-old company at $12.5bn, said two people close to the matter. Anduril declined to comment.

Anduril, which also counts Lightspeed among its backers, makes autonomous weapons and defence systems such as drones, rocket-launchers and submarines and is a growing supplier to the US armed forces. It was co-founded by 31-year-old entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, whose previous start-up, Oculus VR, was bought by Facebook in 2014 for $2bn.

    title: 'Israel’s push to create a ‘dead zone’ in Lebanon',
    summary: 'As Hizbollah and Israel trade cross-border fire, radar data and interviews show attacks have ravaged 5km-wide strip of land',
    content: `

  Over nearly nine months of simmering conflict with the Hizbollah militant group, Israel’s military has laid waste to swaths of southern Lebanon.
  
  Even as diplomats scramble to prevent a full-scale war that could inflame the region, Israeli attacks have destroyed or badly damaged buildings and infrastructure, farmland and forests, as well as striking Hizbollah military targets. In the scattered villages and towns that dot the frontier, some entire neighbourhoods have been levelled.
  
  Most of the destruction has taken place within a 5km corridor just north of the Blue Line, the UN-drawn border between the two countries, according to analysis of satellite imagery, radar data and government statistics, along with interviews with local and state officials, researchers, civil defence workers and residents.
  
  Data gathered by the Financial Times suggests that as diplomatic negotiations sputter, the Israeli military has used force to create a new reality on the ground. Near-daily aerial bombardment, artillery shelling and the incendiary chemical white phosphorus have made much of the 5km north of the Blue Line uninhabitable.
  
  Structural damage, environmental degradation and economic harm have left a strip of land resembling the “buffer zone” that Israel wants to establish in Lebanon. Just handfuls of civilians remain. Most buildings are empty; many have been destroyed.
  
  Attempts to negotiate a deal that would include Hizbollah pulling back from the border have not succeeded. But the area has become a de facto military zone, patrolled by Hizbollah fighters, Lebanese armed forces and UN peacekeepers.
  
  The FT combined data from commercial satellites with research from the CUNY Graduate Center and Oregon State University. The researchers apply a technique using imagery from “synthetic aperture radar” satellites, which can detect changes to buildings, and is unaffected by cloud cover.

    title: 'To cure disease, AI needs more of our data',
    summary: 'Information about patients remains ‘liquid gold’ when it comes to enriching medical research',
    content: `
  Machines have already outsmarted humans at playing chess, identifying birdsong and predicting complex protein structures. But when it comes to the really clever and intuitive stuff, like original scientific research, we humans like to think that we still have the advantage.
  
  We may need to think again. At the RAAIS artificial intelligence conference in London earlier this month, Daniel Cohen, president of the Canadian drug discovery company Valence Labs discussed the tantalising, if slightly unnerving, possibility of “autonomous scientific discovery”. Trained on specialist data, sophisticated AI models might soon be able to generate hypotheses, design and run experiments, learn from the results and rinse and repeat 24/7. “Our mission is to industrialise scientific discovery,” he said.
  
  You do not need to talk to people in computational biology for long to understand their excitement about AI. The AI research company Google DeepMind has even spun off a separate company, Isomorphic Labs, to exploit this domain after its AlphaFold program modelled 200mn protein structures.
  
  The promise is that computational biology can help advance scientific research, accelerate drug discovery and improve patient outcomes. Machines have a number of advantages over their flesh-and-blood researcher and lab assistant counterparts. For one thing they do not need to sleep, deal with colds, hangovers or messy relationships.
  
  “I am so encouraged by the pace at which the field is moving,” Christina Curtis, professor of genetics and biomedical data science at the Stanford University School of Medicine, tells me. “This is changing how we understand disease, how we detect malignancy and how we treat and intercept it.”
  
  Curtis was the senior author of a paper, published in Science last month, that explores the heritability of malignancy in various subsets of cancer. Using machine learning techniques, the researchers parsed thousands of genomes from individuals with pre-invasive and invasive breast tumours to explore differences in their immunological response to the disease. They found that the way tumour cells evolved in individuals was “sculpted” by the germ line genome they inherited at conception.
  
  Such research might lead to earlier detection and more personalised treatments, improving the chances of survival. “More than 50 per cent of cancer diagnoses are stage 4 or beyond. We are getting information too late to aid decision making,” Curtis says. “Ideally, we can do this more pre-emptively.”
  
  There are two big constraints. The first is that “genetics provides hints not answers”, according to one industry executive. Machines have flagged plenty of targets for drug development, but few successful products have been released. Even if the technology does lead to scientific breakthroughs, it takes many years to win regulatory approval for new drugs. 
  
  Thore Graepel, the global lead for computational science at Altos Labs, previously helped develop the AlphaGo program at Google DeepMind. AlphaGo’s defeat of the world’s strongest player at the ancient game of Go was seen as a mind-blowing breakthrough in machine intelligence. But Graepel told the RAAIS conference that the biological complexities he now confronts in cell rejuvenation were “orders of magnitude” greater. “I have never seen so much complexity with so little data,” he said.
  
  The second constraint is data sparsity. Curtis argues that patient data is like “liquid gold” for researchers but we do not yet have the mechanisms to capture it routinely. Of most use would be to combine a patient’s genetic information with longitudinal health data gathered throughout their treatments and lives.
  
  Reorienting healthcare systems towards early monitoring and prevention and away from late diagnosis and treatment will require a monumental transformation of cumbersome organisations. But Britain’s Labour party, which appears poised to win next week’s general election, promises to accelerate this transformation in the National Health Service. Labour’s manifesto pledges to create a “Fit For the Future” fund to double the number of CT and MRI scanners to detect early-stage cancers.
  
  Voters are rightly sceptical of politicians making big promises. But the strains on public finances in ageing societies may soon leave governments with no option but to follow this route. As the Dutch philosopher Desiderius Erasmus supposedly told us five centuries ago: “Prevention is better than cure.” To that end, AI may be among our greatest assets.`,

    title: 'India set for billions of dollars of inflows as bonds join JPMorgan index',
    summary: 'Inclusion of country’s debt in major benchmark could fuel market volatility, analysts warn',
    content: `
  India is set to welcome billions of dollars of foreign inflows when JPMorgan adds the country’s sovereign debt to its emerging markets index on Friday, a move that some analysts say will leave it more vulnerable to fickle flows of hot money.
  
  The inclusion of India marks the first time the bonds of the world’s fastest-growing large economy have been included in a major benchmark and is the latest move to open up a once closed-off market. It was only in 2020 that India removed foreign ownership restrictions on some rupee-denominated debt.
  
  The inclusion of 28 government bonds worth more than $400bn will give India a 10 per cent share of the widely tracked measure, according to JPMorgan.
  
  About $11bn has flowed into Indian bonds as investors position themselves ahead of the formal inclusion, according to Goldman Sachs. The bank expects a further $30bn to arrive as the bonds are gradually incorporated into the index over the next 10 months, raising foreign ownership from around 2 per cent to about 5 per cent.
  
  The entry caps years of negotiations between India’s government, banks and investors, during which the country eased some burdensome administrative controls and improved bond tradability.
  
  “The sentiment of it is quite significant,” said Carlos Carranza, portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, which has bought Indian debt. “It is now on every investor’s radar and maybe before this inclusion there wasn’t even a reason to look at it given the capital controls.”
  
  India is expected to be one of the fastest-growing economies in the world this year, with the United Nations forecasting an expansion of 7 per cent.
  
  The yield on the country’s benchmark 10-year government bond has fallen 0.19 percentage points so far this year to 6.98 per cent, reflecting rising prices. But many funds are likely to be still overcoming complex bureaucratic hurdles to market entry.
  
  “There is this perception that investors have already front run the flows, but we tend to disagree,” added Carranza. “Many investors in the industry have to set up their accounts to be able to trade Indian bonds . . . those processes, in my experience, take time.”
  
  The addition comes weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, feted by investors for market-friendly reforms, became reliant on coalition partners after his Bharatiya Janata party lost its parliamentary majority. The shock election result initially caused a spike in Indian yields and fall in stock prices, but the impact proved shortlived.
  
  “There was a lot of nervousness with the outcome,” said Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global Financial Services in Mumbai. “People have moved on from there.”
  
  S&P Global in May said it expected broad economic continuity regardless of the election outcome, announcing that it was considering lifting India’s triple B minus credit rating.
  
  Modi remains “obsessed with fiscal targeting . . . he really wants to get India upgraded by the likes of S&P”, Arora said. India “is still giving a good yield premium compared to its peers and there’s the growth story, inflation is looking good”, she added.
  
  With Russia’s ejection from JPMorgan’s index after invading Ukraine and China’s weakening economy, India may also be added to other fixed-income benchmarks, according to Gaurav Narain, manager of the India Capital Growth Fund in Mumbai.
  
  Indian bonds will enter the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Currency Government Index from January, while the country’s debt is being considered by the UK’s FTSE Russell.
  
  However, fast-moving flows could complicate Indian central bank efforts to control market volatility. Arora said foreign investors may “see the wind is changing and they’ll withdraw”.
  
  The Reserve Bank of India has downplayed those concerns. Earlier this month Governor Shaktikanta Das said that there should be “no worries” over the central bank being able to handle the ebbs and surges. “We have managed it in the past and we will manage it this time also,” he said.
  
  Analysts and fund managers see India’s more than $650bn foreign reserves as ample ammunition to keep the rupee stable.
  
  “There is bound to be more volatility as India gets even more integrated with the global markets,” Narain said. “Currently the reserves seem sufficient and will only increase with this inclusion.”

    title: 'Companies slash borrowing costs on $400bn of US junk loans',
    summary: 'Borrowers benefit from equivalent of two Fed rate cuts as demand for debt booms',
    content: `
  US companies have been able to reprice almost $400bn of debt at lower interest rates this year due to booming investor appetite for junk loans, in an easing of financing conditions for corporate America.
  
  Even before the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates from a 23-year high, a number of borrowers in the US leveraged loan market have benefited from the equivalent of two quarter-point Fed cuts, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs.
  
  The $391bn of so-called repricing deals is the highest ever at this point in the year, according to data from PitchBook LCD going back to 2002, equal to more than a quarter of the $1.34tn leveraged loan market.
  
  Demand has been driven by investment vehicles that repackage and sell on risky loans and by fund managers. A record share of this year’s issuance has been borrowers rolling over loans, rather than selling new debt before the Fed has cut rates. This has left investors fighting over a limited pool of loans.
  
  “We don’t have the supply of loans to actually feed into that demand for new issuance, and that just means that investors are competing for the same assets,” said Bob Schwartz, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein. “There’s nothing else to buy. That just fuels the repricing wave.”
  
  The figures are a boost to highly indebted companies that have suffered as the Fed has kept borrowing costs at 5.25 to 5.5 per cent in order to finish its fight against the biggest surge in inflation in a generation. Predictions about the future path of monetary policy have fluctuated wildly in recent months: investors expected six or seven rate cuts this year back in January, but are now betting on fewer than two.
  
  In one of this year’s largest deals, Cloud Software Group, parent company of Citrix, lowered borrowing costs on a $6.5bn loan by 0.5 percentage points to 4 percentage points above the overnight benchmark rate, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
  
  Healthcare company Medline reduced the spread on a $6.1bn loan from 3 to 2.75 percentage points in March.
  
  This year’s wave of repricings — which differ from refinancing deals, in which companies issue fresh loans to replace maturing debt — has come amid particularly strong demand for leveraged loans, whose coupons are floating and linked to prevailing US interest rates.

  Demand has outstripped supply, pushing the price of existing loans above their face value and therefore enabling companies to reprice them at lower borrowing costs. Thirty-nine per cent of the junk loan market was priced at or above par last Friday, according to the PitchBook LCD data, down from a peak of 65 per cent in mid-May but still substantially higher than just 2.4 per cent a year ago.

  The current situation is a “paradox”, said Goldman’s chief credit strategist Lotfi Karoui. “The delayed start to the easing cycle has ended up actually boosting inflows into bank loans as an asset class — and that’s boosting prices, pushing them above par or around par, and making the economics of repricing quite attractive for borrowers.”

  Much of the demand is being driven by surging issuance of so-called collateralised loan obligations, which buy junk loans and package them into different risk categories and sell the tranches on to investors.

  Issuance of CLOs, which account for roughly two-thirds of demand for US leveraged loans, has almost doubled to $100bn so far in 2024, the PitchBook LCD figures show, the highest year-to-date figure since at least 2012.

  One banker pointed to “a lot of energy” around the buying of triple-A grade CLO tranches in recent months, which they said was driving even faster creation of these vehicles.

  Issuance of new leveraged loans, meanwhile, has not increased at the same pace as demand from CLOs and other loan investors.

  Some low-grade companies had also been able to cope with a high interest rate environment better than feared, helped by the US economy proving more robust than expected, said bankers and investors.

  “It’s almost the perfect storm of really healthy fundamentals, really healthy investor interest in the asset class, elevated base rates [and] a pretty benign default environment,” said Brian Barnhurst, head of global credit research at PGIM.

  However, the opportunity to push down costs had largely been open to higher-quality junk loan issuers, while the weakest borrowers had been left behind, said investors and analysts. They added that even after the recent flurry of repricing deals, interest expenses for loan issuers remained much higher than just a few years ago because US interest rates were higher.

  Reducing interest costs of 8 or 9 per cent by 0.5 or 0.75 percentage points should certainly help a company, said Schwartz, “but you didn’t just cut your debt cost in half . . . it’s not like a game-changer”.

    title: 'EU trade ‘not working’ for UK business, warns lobby group',
    summary: 'British Chambers of Commerce urges next prime minister to deepen ties with bloc in order to boost growth',
    content: `
        
  The next UK government must stop “walking on eggshells” around improving EU trade ties, the head of the UK’s largest business organisation has warned.
  
  Shevaun Haviland, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, on Thursday urged the winner of next week’s election to deepen the current EU-UK trade and co-operation deal in order to boost economic growth.
  
  “We must stop walking on eggshells and start saying it how it is. The current plan isn’t working for our members,” she said at the group’s annual international conference in London. 
  
  Haviland’s intervention came as opinion polls put Labour on track to secure a large majority on July 4 on a platform that promises to lift Britain out of a decade of economic stagnation.
  
  The Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, has said Brexit will cause a 4 per cent long-run hit to UK GDP, alongside a 15 per cent reduction in UK trade.
  
  Analysis published this month by the London School of Economics found that 20,000 small businesses had stopped exporting to the EU as a result of red tape created by the UK exiting the bloc’s single market.
  
  The BCC, which represents more than 50,000 businesses employing 6mn people in the UK, has published a trade manifesto that calls for a series of measures to improve EU-UK trade. They include a youth mobility deal to enable young people to live and work in each other’s countries — a policy Labour has already ruled out.
  
  Haviland said the BCC stands ready to work with the next government on a long-term strategy for trade. “After six weeks of electioneering, businesses will be looking at the next government and who will be true to their word,” she added. 
  
  Labour has been cautious about its plans for reducing the costs of Brexit, which was strongly backed by voters in “red wall” seats in the north of England that it hopes to win back from the Conservatives next week.
  
  The main opposition party has ruled out a return to the EU single market or a customs union with Brussels, while promising in its election manifesto to improve ties by “tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade”.
  
  However, the only concrete measures set out by Labour are a veterinary agreement with Brussels to help food and plant exports, a visa deal for touring musicians, and improved terms for professionals such as engineers and architects. 
  
  Analysis by UK in a Changing Europe, a think-tank, this month said that Labour’s stated plans would have a “minimal” impact on reducing the economic costs of Brexit.

  Starmer’s party has sought to play down accusations from the Tories that it will seek to reverse Brexit if elected, with both sides clashing on the subject during a televised election debate on Monday.

  Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was “ridiculous” to suggest Brexit had not hit UK trade. “The biggest thing a Labour government will bring is our relationship to the European Union will not be governed by the internal politics of the Conservative party,” he said.  

  Reynolds added that he wanted to reduce checks on food and agricultural products but declined to say whether Labour would accept a role for the European Court of Justice as part of any veterinary deal, saying he was “not going to give away our negotiating hand”. 
  
  Business secretary Kemi Badenoch countered that the Conservatives had already tried to secure a veterinary deal and that Labour’s plan to reopen talks “is just going to be taking us back into the EU without saying so”.
